# Learn Go with Tests

My stab at doing the exercises at https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests, along witht my notes.

I am using VS Code, and installed the optional Delve debugger and golangci-lint per the recommendations.

I'm trying to use my own weird version of SemVer here: major revisions correspond to new sections below. Minor revisions indicate a new section was added, and patch versions are for fixes.

1. [Hello World](hello_world/README.md)
2. [Integers](integers/README.md)
